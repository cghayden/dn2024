Ella is very interested in science and engineering, and has repeatedly said that she "wants to work for NASA." I have witnessed her eyes light up when she sees the maker spaces and robotics labs on college tours with her older sister. Being familiar with the STEAM lab at Lincoln, I knew she would love what she saw.

She is full of self initiative and is always coming up with business ideas that she'd like to pursue. She recently proudly declared, "I'm getting a job as soon as I turn fourteen."

Ella is a clever problem solver. If there is something she wants to achieve, she is determined, and will find a way. An example of this is how in fourth grade she figured out that by creating a Word document and sharing it over Teams with her sister at the high school, they could then talk together during the school day.

Ella is inquisitive and thinks deeply into matters. One recent evening when I was reading a book to her, two characters who spoke different languages were trying to communicate. Suddenly, Ella turned to me with this look of wonder on her face, saying, "Wait, what language do babies think in if they can't talk?" I was so impressed that this fictional situation had prompted that insight from her.

I point out these traits of Ella's because we don't believe her current school allows those traits to flourish. She is often lost in the mix. She often feels disempowered and disrespected because she is bound to the rules that have been implemented in response to disruptive behavior of others. She is often overwhelmed by the size and chaotic setting, and she frequently complains of being bored. She is someone who would rather stay inside and paint in the art room rather than go outside for recess.

We believe that the environment of Lincoln School would be a tremendous enhancement to Ella's ability to thrive and her sense of confidence. It would be such a gift to be able to provide her with a calm, respectful setting that provides her with a more interactive approach that rewards a child's natural inquisitiveness. We believe she will enjoy school more when she knows she will be involved in work that is more engaging and interesting, surrounded by like-minded classmates. These middle and high school years of a child's life will shape the trajectory of their adulthood, and we want Ella to feel empowered to follow her passions and even to discover new interests and abilities she may not have the confidence to pursue in her current school environment.

It is for these reasons, among others, that we would be thrilled to give her the opportunity to experience what a different educational setting can do for her.
